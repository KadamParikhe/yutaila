Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing (GD&T) workbench for FreeCAD

Abstract
----------

The project is aimed at the development of a labeling software module for Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing (GD&T) in 2D and 3D technical drawings. The main contributions of this software are:

-	Allows the GD&T information to be added to the design itself, thus linking design, manufacturing and quality specifications.
-	Implements the ISO16792 standard for both 2D and 3D parts.
-	Incorporates a homogeneous graphical interface and integrated with the technical design tools and 3D.
-	There is no precedent developed as free software.

The implementation of the software is done as a module of the parametric modeling free software application [FreeCAD](http://freecadweb.org). This is a multiplatform project since the development of the module is done with Python and FreeCAD has compilations for multiple Operating Systems.

Installing
----------

Download and install your corresponding version of FreeCAD from [wiki Download page](http://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/Download) and then copy the FreeCAD-GDT folder to the directory Mod of the application FreeCAD.

### Requirements

- Coin3D (4.0+) It is recommended to have Coin version 4.0 or higher installed but also works with version 3.0 but with some visual changes.
